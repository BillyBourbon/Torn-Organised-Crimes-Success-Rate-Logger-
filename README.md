## What is this project?
This project aims to make the planning of Organised Crimes 2.0 easier.
it is comprised of 2 main parts. The userscript and the webapp.
The userscript works on the OC tab of the faction page. It pulls the current users success rates for all joinable roles present on the page aswell as the success rates of faction mates who have joined a role. The next time the OC tab is loaded the script will upload any role data it has collected to the web app.
The webapp contains 2 routes. a Post and a Get route. *Notes 1*
The data collected from the userscript can then be viewed via the webapp after its been uploaded to the spreadsheet

## How to set it up?
 1 - Userscript
 2 - Webapps

**Notes**
  *1 - you may seperate these into 2 distinct webapps if you wish (One for Get one for Post). id suggest this as it makes it so the script users dont need to keep updating the webapp url everytime a new version of the Get route is released. still need to update it everytime the post route gets updated but you shouldnt really need to update that anywhere near as often*
